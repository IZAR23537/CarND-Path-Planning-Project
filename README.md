# CarND-Path-Planning-Project

## Goals
In this project the goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. The car's localization and sensor fusion data is provided, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Reflection

### Compilation
 
The code compiles without any errors. No modification were made on the initial setup.

### Speed Limit, Max Acceleration and Jerk

The maximum speed that in this project is 50 mph, therefore I set up the car's maximum speed to be 49.5 mph. In order to avoid jerk in the initial speed up phase, I set up the acceleration to increment the speed value by 0.224 each time step.

### Collision Avoidance

Using the sensor data, the cars speed and distance from our car can be calculated. 
To avoid collision we check if there is a car in front of us and calculate the distance between the front and our car, if the distance is smaller than the safe distance that we set up, then our car slows down. Also, I set up an emergency break, if a car next to us suddenly change its current lane.

### Lane Change

Lane change occurs when a car front of us in our lane is getting too close to us.

Our car has three simple option about how to deal with this situation.

1. If there is no car in the left lane within the safe distance (checking the distance front and back), then the car goes to the left lane.

2. If there is no car in the right lane within the safe distance (checking the distance front and back), then the car goes to the right lane.

3. If both of the side lanes are occupied, then the car slows down to avoid collision.

### Path generation	

For the smooth path trajectory generation we use a list of widely spaced (x,y) waypoints, which are evenly spaced (30m). In order to generate the new trajectory, the simulator uses the car's current state or the previous path's end point. In Frenet, we add evenly spaced points (30m) ahead of the starting reference. We create a spline for the smooth curve genration and calculating how to break up the spline points so that we can travel at our desired reference velocity. After filling it with previous points, we fill up the rest of our path planner.
